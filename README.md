Discord Rich presence for discord

All Rights Reserved.

How 2 use:
- set up local node server
- open developer console in discord and paste the client side code

Is this allowed?
- i mean it still uses the vanilla client
- probably in a grey area
- use at your own risk

What if i put it in discord's js files to run on startup?
- that's probably less likely to be allowed
- then again, some ppl use betterdiscord and discord doesnt do shit about it, and that's arguably a worse offender than this.
